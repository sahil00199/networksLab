DETAILS OF DESIGN AND HANDLING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS:

PHY LAYER ENCODING :- We are transmitting the bits using color signals. We will write a python script which will take the message as input and the corresponding postitions of error. Then we will use the appendCRC function in 'appendCRC.py' to append the CRC at the end of message. Then this CRC appended message will be passed as argument to makeSignal function of the makeSignal.py script which will flash the corresponding signals according to the following scheme:

	color1 : Red          (for 1 second)     : bit 0
	color2 : Green        (for 1 second)     : bit 1
	color3 : Yellow       (for 0.1 seconds)  : intermediate for marking end of bit signal
	color4 : Light Blue   (for 1 second)     : for marking end of packet

LINK LAYER FRAMING :- We are marking the end of a packet by using the color4.

RECEIVING SIGNALS :- We will be manually receiving the signals, i.e., one receiver will be sitting at the receiver computer to decode the light signals.
