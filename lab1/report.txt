Question 1:
My machine's host name is "SahilLaptop" and the IP address "10.196.21.241".
To find the host name we saw the contents of /etc/hostname and to find the IP address, we used the ifconfig command.

Question 2:
The next hop's IP address is "10.196.0.2" and we found this using the "gateway" entry of the first row using the "route -n" command.
The MAC address is "00:04:96:83:a0:8e" and we found this using the "arp" command and used the entry in the "HWaddress" column corresponding to the "10.196.0.2" row.

Question 3:
The local DNS server's hostname is "nameserver" and the IP address is "127.0.1.1"
We found this in the /etc/resolv.conf

Question 4:
They are the Assigned Internet Protocol Numbers, and are found in the "Protocol" field of the IPv4 header. This is the number that is used to determine (in the Network Layer) which protocol of the Transport layer is to be called when the message moves up the layers. This is used in multiplexing/demultiplexing.

Question 5:
SSH: 22 (for both tcp and udp)
FTP: 21 (for tcp)
NFS: 2049 (for tcp and udp)
SMTP (email): 25 (for tcp)

We got this information from the /etc/services file

Question 1:
-open WireShark using sudo wireshark (and select the Wireless option)
-open a terminal and run the following command: wget http://www.iitb.ac.in
-filter using the command: ip.addr == 10.102.1.111
-stop wireframe and use File->Export selected packets

Question 2:
a) The next hop node's MAC address (as found from the "Destination" field of the "Ethernet" header) is "00:04:96:83:a0:8e".
   The IP address for the next hop node is "10.196.0.2" (which is the same as the IP address of the next hop node found in the previous question)

b) The final destination's IP address is "10.102.1.111". The MAC address, however, cannot be determined at the soure.

c) The layers and the fields used along with their values are listed below:
	LAYER 				FIELD NAME 				VALUE 						PROCESS (PROTOCOL PASSED TO)
	
1.  link (Ethernet)    Type (Frame Type)      2048 (0x0800)					   	IPv4
2.  IP 				   Protocol  			  6								   	TCP
3.  TCP 			   Port  				  80								HTTP

Question 1:
-open WireFrame using sudo wireframe (and select the Wireless option)
-open a terminal and run the following commands:
  -ping 10.196.15.74
  -ssh sahilshah@mars.cse.iitb.ac.in
-filter using the command: arp || icmp || ssh
-stop wireframe and use File->Export selected packets

Question 2:
a) The lowest layer that handles this packet is the link(ethernet) layer and this passes it to the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). This is determined by the value of the Type field (0x0806). It is then passed to Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) using the protocol field which has value (0x0800).

b) The decimal value of the Type field of the Ethernet header is 2054 (0x0806).


Question 3:
a) The lowest layer that handles it is the link (ethernet) layer which passes it to the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) using the Type field of the header which has value 0x0800 or 2048. The IPv4 layer then passes it to the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) using the Protocol field which has value 1.

Ethernet -> IPv4 -> ICMP

b) The packet is passed to the Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) using the Type field which has a decimal value of 2048.

c) The Protocol field is used to pass to the ICMP and it has value 1.


Question 4:
a) The source IP address is: 10.129.3.5
   The destination IP address is: 10.196.21.241

b) The source port is 22
   The destination port is 36212

c) The SSH server has IP addres: 10.129.3.5
   We deduced this using the fact that the SSH server listens on port 22 and the source port is 22 and hence the source address is the IP of the SSH server.

Question 1:
X is the time stamp (as per the machine time) of the time at which the last packet was received and the download ended.
Y is the throughput (data-rate or speed) of the download. It is calculated using the total size of the download (obtained by adding the size of all the packets involved in the download) and dividing it by the total time taken (which is the difference between the timestamp of the first and last packets involved in the download).
Z is the total size of the download in bits (and is calculated by summing the sizes of all the individual packets that make up the download).


Question 2:
The download speed is 9.86 Mbps. We are connected to a WiFi link with a speed of 150 Mbps.


Question 3:
<no answer>

Question 4:
Looking at the time of the different packets, we observe that the difference in the time stamps of the ICMP packets "request" and "reply" is equal to the time that is displayed by the "ping" command.
